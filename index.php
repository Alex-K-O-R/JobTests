    <h3>Vending machine</h3>
    <p>
        One day I've got a sort of <a href="/vendingmachine/webbuild_vending-machine.pdf">technical specifications</a> for the vending machine.
        It took about 6-8 hours to <a href="/vendingmachine/">deliver the result</a> (debug and polishing included).
        Requires PHP 8.2+ and rights to create and modify subdirectories and files.
    </p>
    <h3>Complex numbers</h3>
    <p>
        Interesting task of PHP 7.* epoch. Cool own bycicle.
        The short stated task: create class of complex numbers, define some basic operations, do tests as a proof. <a href="/complex/">Done there</a>, took up to 4 hours to create.
